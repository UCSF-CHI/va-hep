HBeAg-Positive Patients with Elevated ALT and Without Cirrhosis

*Cut off (Upper limit of normal= ULN) of a normal ALT  ≤35 U/L for males and ≤25 U/L for females is recommended to guide management decision

**Additionally monitor HBeAg every 6-12 mo

***Other factors in decision to treat elevated ALT that is < 2x upper limit and HBV DNA is < 20,000:
Age > 40, Family history of HCC, Previous treatment history, Presence of extrahepatic manifestations, presence of cirrhosis
